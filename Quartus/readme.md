This project has 3 top-level files (v1. v2. v3), they differ in the way the PPU is coupled with the VRAM interface. 
Choose the option that suits you and make it "as a top-level file" in the Quartus settings. 
The project is fully assembled and compiled. I have not tested its functionality in other development environments. 
Good luck! :)
